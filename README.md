## Introduction

This repository contains code for different algorithms and datastructures in programming languages that I'm interested in for personal and professional reasons.

The current languages I am using are (in no particular order):

1. Python
2. Go
3. Rust
4. Lua
5. Java
6. TypeScript

More languages will be added as I go

## Algorithms

The current algorithms are

1. Sorting Algorithms:
	1. Bubble Sort
	2. Insertion Sort
	3. Selection Sort
	4. Quick Sort
2. Searching Algorithms:
	1. Linear Search
	2. Binary Search
	3. Jump Search

## Data Structures

The current algorithms are:

1. Linked Lists:
	1. Singly Linked Lists
	2. Doubly Linked Lists
	3. Double Circular Linked Lists
2. Stacks
3. Queues
4. Hash Tables
5. Binary Trees
6. Red-Black Trees
7. Graphs
8. AVL Tree

## Contributing

If you would like to help me write better algorithms feel free to download the contents of this repository and add to the tests I have written to add corner cases that I may not have thought of. If you find a fault in my algorithm or see I missed a corner case in my tests feel free to create an issue with the error and the expected behavior and why. I will update my code and run your tests. Anyone who helps will be added to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
